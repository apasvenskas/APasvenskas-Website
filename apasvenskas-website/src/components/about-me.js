            <h3>Intrest in Software Development</h3>
            <p>I can remember the first day my mom brought a computer to the apartment we lived in Lithuania. At the time I was around 7 years old. Right away it was something special my previos experience with computers was limited to brief introductions to video game consoles such as SEGA and Nintendo. Eventhought, I was not alowed to touch the desktop without supervision of my mother. Over the years I ended up spending more and more time with it. At the time my mother worked as acountant in a new Lithuanian startup company that developed finiancial acounting Software.</p>

          <p>
            I have Bachelors of Science degree from California State University
            Maritime Academy. I studied Maritime Transportation. Once I finished
            studies and passed all the requered USCG test I also received a
            third mate's unlimited license for all the oeceans. It is a license
            to navigate a vessel as a mate/officer. The studies were challenging
            some of the most challenging classes were Celestial Navigation,
            Radar, GMDSS, and Ship Stability. Nonetheless, the 7 USCG exams were
            the most challenging part of all the studies since they were
            comprehensive on entire material studied during the years, and they
            all had to be passed in order to graduate.

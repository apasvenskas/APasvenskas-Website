          <p>
            The current experience recarding software development and
            programin/coding in general is mainly with Bloomtech and Ren'Py as a
            hobby. Bloomtech is by far the more educational and challenging out
            of the two involving frontend and backend of software devoplemnt.
            While at Bloomtech used and worked with html, css, javaScript,
            react, redux, jets, and node. Not tomention all the other variuos
            tools that havent that havent been mentioned such as tailwind and
            github. As far as Ren'Py goes it is a hobby. Ren'Py is used to creat
            visual novel games. The code is based upone pyhtone; however, the
            functions and code required are not to complicated.{" "}
